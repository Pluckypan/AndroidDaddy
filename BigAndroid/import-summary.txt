ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* ic_launcher-web.png
* log.txt
* my.keystore
* proguard-project.txt
* readme.doc

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => x5WebDemo/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => x5WebDemo/src/main/assets/
* libs/armeabi/liblbs.so => x5WebDemo/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/liblbs.so
* libs/tbs_sdk_thirdapp_v2.2.0.1096_36549_sharewithdownload_withoutGame_obfs_20160830_211645.jar => x5WebDemo/libs/tbs_sdk_thirdapp_v2.2.0.1096_36549_sharewithdownload_withoutGame_obfs_20160830_211645.jar
* lint.xml => x5WebDemo/lint.xml
* res/ => x5WebDemo/src/main/res/
* src/ => x5WebDemo/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
